# React.js Projects Core - Advanced⚛⚛

These project ideas cover various concepts in React.js along with other related topics, providing opportunities for learning and practicing different aspects of building React applications, including state management, routing, authentication, and more.

Topics Covered:
- React Core Concepts:
  - JSX (JavaScript XML)
  - Fragments
  - Components (Functional components, Class components, Pure components)
  - Props and State (Passing props, Updating state, Immutable data handling)
- React Router:
  - Setting up React Router (BrowserRouter or HashRouter, Route component)
  - Nested Routes
  - Route Parameters
  - Programmatic Navigation
  - Redirects and Guards
  - Lazy Loading Routes
- State Management:
  - Redux (Actions, Reducers, Store, Middleware)
  - MobX (Observables, Actions, Reactions)
  - Recoil (Atoms, Selectors, State management)
  - Context API with useReducer
  - Immer for Immutable State
  - Redux Toolkit (Simplifying Redux boilerplate, Thunks, Slices)
  - Zustand (Lightweight state management)

## 1. Dynamic Tooltip Component with Render Prop

- **Topics Covered**: Render Props, Dynamic Content Rendering, Event Handling
- **Description**: Create a tooltip component that accepts a render prop for custom content. Users can hover over certain elements to trigger the tooltip and display dynamic content.

## 2. Dropdown Menu Component with Render Prop

- **Topics Covered**: Render Props, Dynamic Item Rendering, Event Handling
- **Description**: Build a dropdown menu component that uses a render prop to render dynamic items. Users can click on the dropdown to select items from a list.

## 3. Higher-Order Components for Authentication

- **Topics Covered**: Higher-Order Components, Authentication Logic, Protected Routes
- **Description**: Implement higher-order components for handling authentication logic. HOCs can manage user authentication status and provide protected routes for authenticated users.

## 4. Compound Components for Form Validation

- **Topics Covered**: Compound Components, Form Validation, State Management
- **Description**: Develop a form component with compound components for input fields. Each input field component handles its own validation logic, and the form component aggregates validation results.

## 5. Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components in a Form

- **Topics Covered**: Controlled Components, Uncontrolled Components, Form Handling
- **Description**: Create a form component that demonstrates the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components. Users can input data into controlled and uncontrolled input fields to observe their behavior.

## 6. Context API for Theme Switching

- **Topics Covered**: Context API, Theme Management, Dynamic Styling
- **Description**: Build a theme-switching feature using the Context API. Components can consume the theme context to dynamically adjust their styles based on the selected theme.

## 7. Error Boundary for Error Handling

- **Topics Covered**: Error Boundaries, Error Handling, Fallback UIs
- **Description**: Implement an error boundary component to catch and display errors in a React application. Users can interact with components that may throw errors to observe the error boundary's behavior.

## 8. Portal Modal Component

- **Topics Covered**: Portals, Modal Windows, DOM Manipulation
- **Description**: Create a modal component that uses portals to render outside of its parent DOM hierarchy. Users can trigger the modal to display overlays or additional content.

## 9. Recipe Sharing Platform with React Router

- **Features**: React Router, Route Parameters, Programmatic Navigation, Redirects
- **Description**: A platform for sharing recipes with features like dynamic routes for recipe details, programmatic navigation for adding/editing recipes, and redirects for authentication.

## 10. Real Estate Listing Website with React Router

- **Features**: React Router, Nested Routes, Route Parameters, Redirects
- **Description**: An online platform for listing real estate properties with features like nested routes for property details, route parameters for dynamic pages, and redirects for authentication.

## 11. Task Management System with React Router

- **Features**: React Router, Nested Routes, Route Parameters, Redirects
- **Description**: A task management system with features like nested routes for task categories, route parameters for dynamic task pages, and redirects for authentication.

## 12. Health & Fitness Tracker App with React Router

- **Features**: React Router, Route Parameters, Programmatic Navigation, Redirects
- **Description**: A fitness tracker app with features like dynamic routes for workout details, programmatic navigation for logging workouts, and redirects for authentication.

## 13. Job Search Platform with React Router

- **Features**: React Router, Nested Routes, Route Parameters, Redirects
- **Description**: A platform for job searching with features like nested routes for job categories, route parameters for dynamic job pages, and redirects for authentication.
